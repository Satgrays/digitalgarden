# Welcome
Welcome to Satgrays' Computer. This is a Digital Garden for Computer Science.

## Personal Experience
I just realized I needed more CS knowledge. As a Data Scientists, it was not enough with knowing about data bases, mathematics, analytics and a little bit of code on how to extract, clean, select and visualize data. It is also important, and I realized it whenever I got interviewed for a job, that somehow, data scientists were required Leetcode. That was new for me, because I never encountered such problems in classes or internships, however, when I gave it a shot, motivated by a group of CS friends, I realized, I started to like it.

## Resources
What you will find here mainly is a roadmap (based on another roadmaps) on the things you need to know about CS. I want to make it completely free, because knowledge should be for everyone independently of their economic situation.
